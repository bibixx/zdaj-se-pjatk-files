<H1>The Metropolis Algorithm</H1>
<HR>
An example application of the Metropolis algorithm is the solution to the 
"Travelling Salesman" problem, in which the total path distance to visit all 
cities is to be minimized. The Java applet below shows the Metropolis algorithm 
in real time. You may add cities as you wish, by clicking on the map, or adding 
10 random ones at a time, by pressing the Add 10 button. The first, in green, is 
the Salesman's home town, and is always the beginning of the journey. The 
effective temperature can be adjusted by clicking on the thermometer, and you 
can adjust the rate of cooling.
