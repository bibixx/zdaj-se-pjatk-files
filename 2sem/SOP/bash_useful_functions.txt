ls -l -> list files and dir / -a -> list all files and dir (also hidden)
mkdir -> make directory
rmdir -> remove directory
mv -> move directory
cd -> change directory
gedit
head -n -> get first n lines
tail -n -> get last n lines
tr -> transform/translate 

example: 
echo "Hello World" | tr "A-Za-z" "a-zA-Z"
hELLO wORLD

example 2:
echo "wiki wiki" | tr -d "ki"
w w

cut

example: 
ls -l | tr -s " " (deletes more than one whitespace) | cut -f 5,9 -d " " | sort -n 
(this shows files form the biggest size to the smallest, cut -f 5,9 selects filelds delimited by whitespace)

sort
uniq
grep -> selects text having exactly the same pattern

example:
ls -l | grep "^-" | wc -l
(counts files in directory, "^-" means that first char of the line must be - )

Patterns in grep:

grep smug files		{search files for lines with 'smug'}
grep '^smug' files	{'smug' at the start of a line}
grep 'smug$' files	{'smug' at the end of a line}
grep '^smug$' files	{lines containing only 'smug'}
grep '\^s' files	{lines starting with '^s', "\" escapes the ^}
grep '[Ss]mug' files	{search for 'Smug' or 'smug'}
grep 'B[oO][bB]' files	{search for BOB, Bob, BOb or BoB }
grep '^$' files	{search for blank lines}
grep '[0-9][0-9]' file	{search for pairs of numeric digits}

grep '[a-zA-Z]'			{any line with at least one letter}
grep '[^a-zA-Z0-9]		{anything not a letter or number}
grep '[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{4\}'	{999-9999, like phone numbers}
grep '^.$'			{lines with exactly one character}
grep '"smug"'			{'smug' within double quotes}
grep '"*smug"*'			{'smug', with or without quotes}
grep '^\.'			{any line that starts with a Period "."}
grep '^\.[a-z][a-z]'		{line start with "." and 2 lc letters}

cat -> opens a file and reads
wc -> word count / -l counts lines/ -w prints only the word counts / -c prints char counts

(cmd) > (file) - stores output to the file
(cmd) >> (file) - appends output to the file
< (file) - reads data from file name

a=5
b=3
echo $a
echo $[a*b]

"something" - string
`cmd` - performs command
