<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A <b>component</b> represents a modular part of a system that 
	encapsulates its contents and whose manifestation is replaceable within its 
	environment.</li>
	<li>The term &#8220;<b>structure</b>&#8221; refers to a composition of interconnected 
	elements, representing run-time instances collaborating over communications 
	links to achieve some common objectives.</li>
	<li><b>Feature</b>: a property, such as an operation or attribute, that 
	characterizes the instances of a classifier.</li>
	<li><b>Role</b>: the named set of features defined over a collection of 
	entities participating in a particular context.</li>
	<li><b>Part</b>: an element representing a set of instances that are owned 
	by a containing classifier instance or role of a classifier. Parts may be 
	joined by attached connectors and specify configurations of linked instances 
	to be created within an instance of the containing classifier.</li>
	<li>The <b>ports</b> provide mechanisms for isolating a classifier from its 
	environment. This is achieved by providing a point for conducting 
	interactions between the internals of the classifier and its environment. 
	This interaction point is referred to as a &#8220;<b>port</b>.&#8221;</li>
	<li>A classifier can own <i>collaboration uses</i> that relate (aspects of) 
	this classifier to a collaboration. The <b>collaboration</b> describes those 
	aspects of this classifier. Objects in a system typically cooperate with 
	each other to produce the behavior of a system. The behavior is the 
	functionality that the system is required to implement. A behavior of a 
	collaboration will eventually be exhibited by a set of cooperating instances 
	(specified by classifiers) that communicate with each other by sending 
	signals or invoking operations. Collaborations allow us to describe only the 
	relevant aspects of the cooperation of a set of instances by identifying the 
	specific roles that the instances will play. Interfaces allow the externally 
	observable properties of an instance to be specified without determining the 
	classifier that will eventually be used to specify this instance. </li>
	<li><b>Collaboration</b>: the specification of how an operation or 
	classifier, such as a use case, is realized by a set of classifiers and 
	associations playing specific roles used in a specific way. The 
	collaboration defines an interaction</li>
	<li><b>Interaction</b>: a specification of how stimuli are sent between 
	instances to perform a specific task. The interaction is defined in the 
	context of a collaboration.</li>
	<li>Consequentially, the <b>roles</b> in a collaboration will often be typed 
	by interfaces and will then prescribe properties that the participating 
	instances must exhibit, but will not determine what class will specify the 
	participating instances.</li>
	<li>The <b>namestring</b> of a role in an instance specification obeys the 
	following syntax: {&lt;name&gt; [&#8216;/&#8217; &lt;rolename&gt;] | &#8216;/&#8217; &lt;rolename&gt;} [&#8216;:&#8217; &lt;classifiername&gt; 
	[&#8216;,&#8217; &lt;classifiername&gt;]*] or simply: <code>participant-name / role-name : 
	classifier-name</code><br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

	<h2>Composite Structure Diagrams</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A <b>composite structure diagram</b> depicts the internal structure of a 
		classifier in terms of its properties (parts). <b>Package diagrams</b> 
		are just a <i>collection grouping</i>, but composite structure diagram 
		are focused on the underlying <i>classifier structure</i>.</li>
		<li>A <b>part</b> declares that an instance of a classifier may contain a set of 
		instances by composition.  
		References the properties specifying instances that the classifier owns 
		by composition.</li>
		<li>All such instances are destroyed when the containing classifier instance is destroyed. 
		</li>
		<li>As well as showing the internal structure of <i>structured 
		classifiers</i> on a class diagram, you can show this structure on a <i>
		composite structure diagram</i>. The diagram name is the name of the of 
		the structured classifier.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Collaborations</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A <b>collaboration</b> is shown as a dashed ellipse icon containing the 
	name of the collaboration. </li>
	<li>The internal structure of a collaboration as comprised by roles and 
	connectors may be shown in a compartment within the dashed ellipse icon.
	</li>
	<li>Alternatively, a composite structure diagram can be used.</li>
	<li>The primary purpose of collaborations is to explain how a system of 
	communicating entities collectively accomplish a specific task or set of 
	tasks without necessarily having to incorporate detail that is irrelevant to 
	the explanation. It is particularly useful as a means for capturing standard 
	design patterns.</li>
	<li>A dashed arrow with an open arrowhead may be used to show that a 
	collaboration is used in a classifier, optionally labeled with the keyword 
	«represents». A dashed arrow with an open arrowhead may also be used to show 
	that a collaboration represents a classifier, optionally labeled with the 
	keyword «occurrence». The arrowhead points at the owning classifier. When 
	using this presentation option, the <b>role bindings</b> are shown 
	explicitly as dependencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sale and BrokeredSale&nbsp; Example</h2>
<p>This example shows the definition of two collaborations, Sale and 
BrokeredSale. Sale is used twice as part of the definition of BrokeredSale. Sale 
is a collaboration among two roles, a seller and a buyer. An interaction, or 
other behavior specification, could be attached to Sale to specify the steps 
involved in making a Sale.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/compos3.gif"></p>
<p>BrokeredSale is a collaboration among three roles, a <b>producer</b>, a <b>
broker</b>, and a <b>consumer</b>. The specification of BrokeredSale shows that 
it consists of two occurrences of the Sale collaboration, indicated by the 
dashed ellipses. The occurrence wholesale indicates a Sale in which the producer 
is the seller and the broker is the buyer. The occurrence retail indicates a 
Sale in which the broker is the seller and the consumer is the buyer. The 
connectors between sellers and buyers are not shown in the two occurrences; 
these connectors are implicit in the BrokeredSale collaboration in virtue of 
them being comprised of Sale. The BrokeredSale collaboration could itself be 
used as part of a larger collaboration.</p>

	<h2>Structured Classes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Figure 
		below shows two possible views of the Car class. In subfigure (i), Car is shown as having a composition association with 
		role name rear to a class Wheel and an association with role name e to a class Engine. 
		</li>
		<li>In subfigure (ii), the same is 
		specified. However, in addition, in subfigure (ii) it is specified that rear and e belong to the internal structure of the class 
		Car. This allows specification of detail that holds only for instances of the Wheel and Engine classes within the context of 
		the class Car, but which will not hold for wheels and engines in general. For example, subfigure (i) specifies that any 
		instance of class Engine can be linked to an arbitrary number of instances of class Wheel. Subfigure (ii), however, specifies 
		that within the context of class Car, the instance playing the role of e may only be connected to two instances playing the 
		role of rear. In addition, the instances playing the e and rear roles may only be linked if they are roles of the same 
		instance of class Car. In other words, subfigure (ii) asserts additional constraints on the 
		instances of the classes Wheel and Engine, when they are playing the respective roles within an instance of class Car. These 
		constraints are not true for instances of Wheel and Engine in general. Other wheels and engines may be arbitrarily linked as 
		specified in subfigure (i).</li>
	</ul>

	<img border="0" src="images/UML-bo12.gif"><br>A part is shown by graphical nesting of a box symbol with a solid 
		outline representing the part within the symbol representing the containing classifier in a separate compartment. A 
		property specifying an instance that is not owned by composition by the instance of the containing classifier is shown by 
		graphical nesting of a box symbol with a dashed outline.</p>

	<h2><a name="A_composite_structure_of_components_">Composite Structure of 
	Components</h2> </a><br><img border="0" src="images/UML-bo11.gif"><br>Example of a composite structure of components, with connector wiring 
		between provided and required
		interfaces of parts (Note: &#8220;Client&#8221; interface is a subtype of &#8220;Person&#8221;).
		The wiring of components can be represented on structure diagrams by 
		means of classifiers and dependencies between
		them (Note: the ball-and-socket notation above may be used as a notation 
		option for dependency based
		wiring). On composite structure diagrams, detailed wiring can be 
		performed at the role or instance level by defining parts
		and connectors.
