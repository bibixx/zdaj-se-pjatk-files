<h2> <a href="../modules/ExtremeProgramming/rules/userstories.html" name="User_Stories">User Stories</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>A user story is a software system requirement formulated as one or two 
    sentences in the everyday language of the user.
    <pre>Starting Application
The application begins by bringing up the last document the user was working with.</pre>
    <a href="../coffeMaker/index.html">CoffeMaker User Stories</a> <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Developers prioritize them and estimate how long the stories might take 
    to implement (Story Points). Each story will get a 1, 2 or 3 week estimate 
    in &quot;ideal development time&quot;.</li>
  <li>User stories are used for the specification of requirements (together 
    with acceptance tests, (<a href="../coffeMaker/blackboxtests.html">CoffeeMaker 
    tests</a>) in the software engineering method Extreme 
    Programming (XP). </li>
  <li>Each story is written on a small paper note card to ensure 
    that it does not grow too large. </li>
  <li>The stories should be written by the 
    customers for a software project and are their main method of influence on 
    the development.</li>
  <li>User stories are a quick way of handling customer requirements without 
    having to deal with large formal requirement documents and tedious tasks 
    related to maintaining them. </li>
  <li>The intention is to be able to respond faster 
    and with less overhead to rapidly changing real-world requirements.</li>
  <li>A user story is an informal statement of the requirement. </li>
  <li>When a user story 
    is to be implemented, a more formal acceptance test must be written by the 
    customer to ensure that it is later possible to determine whether the goals 
    of the story have been fulfilled.</li>
  <li>You should try to keep stories focused on user needs and benefits as 
    opposed to specifying GUI layouts.</li>

<h2><a name="Use_Cases">Use Cases</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Use cases </b>are a way of capturing requirements.
<SPAN

<li>A use case describes behavior that the system exhibits to benefit one or 
  more actors. 

</SPAN><li>The term <b>actor</b> is used to describe the <b><i>role</i></b> played 
  by people or things that use the system.&nbsp;
  <ul>
    <li>A role is like a hat that something wears in a particular context. </li>

<li>A use case describes the interaction (triggered by an external actor in order 
  to achieve a goal) between a
  system and its environment. </li>
<li>A use case defines a goal-oriented set of 
  interactions between external actors
  and the system under consideration. </li>
<li>A primary actor triggers the system

<h2>Use Cases and Actors<a href="UML-useCases.pdf">(UML 2 Use Case Diagram Specification)</a></h2>
<p><font color="#990000"><b><a name="usecasediagrams" href="UML-useCases.pdf">Use case diagrams</a></b></font> describe what a system does from the standpoint of an external observer. 
  The emphasis is on<i>what</i>a system does rather than<i>how.</i>Use Case analysis is one of the first and primary means of gathering 
  requirements in the behavioral methodology. Use cases are a standard technique 
  for gathering requirements in many modern software development methodologies.</p>
<p>Use case diagrams are closely connected to scenarios. A<b> scenario </b>is an example of what happens when someone interacts 
  with the system. Here is a scenario for a medical clinic.</p>
<div align="left">
  <ul>
    <p>&quot;A patient calls the clinic to make an appointment for a 
      yearly checkup. The receptionist finds the nearest empty time 
      slot in the appointment book and schedules the appointment for 
      that time slot. &quot;</p>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>A<b>use case</b> is a summary of scenarios for a single task or goal. An <b>actor </b>is who or what initiates the events involved in that 
  task. Actors are simply roles that people or objects play. The picture 
  below is a<b> Make Appointment </b>use case for the medical clinic. The 
  actor is a <b>Patient</b>. The connection between actor and use case is 
  a<b> communication association </b>(or <b>communication </b>for short).</p>
<p><img src="images/31863/usecaseactorno3.gif" height="76" width="370" hspace="10" vspace="15" alt="Use case"></p>
<p>Actors are stick figures. Use cases are ovals. Communications are 
  lines that link actors to use cases.</p>
<p>A use case diagram is a collection of actors, use cases, and their 
  communications. We've put<b> Make Appointment</b> as part of a diagram 
  with four actors and four use cases. Notice that a single use case can 
  have multiple actors.</p>

<h2><a name="Use_Case_Diagrams">Use Case Diagrams</a></h2>
<p><b>Use case diagrams</b> give an outsider's view of a system. Every use case 
  diagram has actors, use cases, and communications. A simple use case diagram can 
  be expanded with additional features to display more information.</p>
<p>In the use case diagram you represent the <b>subject </b>of the use case 
  modeled by a box labeled with the name of the subject. You show <b>actors </b>outside the subject and<b> use cases</b>, which constitute the system behavior. 
  Actors and use cases are in<b> relationships </b>that define the structure of a 
  use case model.</p>
<ul>
  <li>system boundaries - the subject of the use case model</li>
  <li>actors - roles adopted by things external to the system</li>
  <li>relationships
    <ul>
      <li>generalizations</li>
      <li>includes</li>
      <li>extensions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<div align="left">The following use case diagram expands use cases defined in the original 
  medical clinic above.</div>
<p><img height="484" alt="Use case diagram" hspace="10" src="images/31863/systemusecase3no.gif" width="608" vspace="15"></p>
<p>A<b>system boundary</b>rectangle separates the clinic system from the 
  external actors.</p>
<p>A use case<b> generalization</b> shows that one use case is simply a special 
  kind of another.<b> Pay Bill</b> is a parent use case and<b> Bill Insurance </b>is the child. A child can be substituted for its parent whenever necessary. 
  Generalization appears as a line with a triangular arrow head toward the parent 
  use case.</p>
<p><b>Include</b>relationships factor use cases into additional ones. Includes 
  are especially helpful when the same use case can be factored out of two 
  different use cases. Both<b> Make Appointment</b> and <b>Request Medication</b> include <b>Check Patient Record</b> as a subtask. In the diagram, include 
  notation is a dotted line beginning at base use case ending with an arrows 
  pointing to the include use case. The dotted line is labeled <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;</font>.</p>
<p>An<b> extend</b> relationship indicates that one use case is a variation of 
  another. Extend notation is a dotted line, labeled<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">&lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt;</font>, 
  and with an arrow toward the base case. The<b> extension point</b>, which 
  determines when the extended case is appropriate, is written inside the base 
  case.</p>
<p>Use case diagrams are helpful in three areas.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>determining features (requirements)</b>. New use cases often 
    generate new requirements as the system is analyzed and the design 
    takes shape.
  <li><b>communicating with clients</b>. Their notational simplicity 
    makes use case diagrams a good way for developers to communicate 
    with clients.
  <li><b>generating acceptance tests</b>. The collection of scenarios for a 
    use case may suggest a suite of test cases for those scenarios.
</ul>

<h2><a name="Use_Case_Descriptions">Use Case Descriptions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A use case is completed successfully when that goal is satisfied.</li>
<li>Use case descriptions also include possible extensions to this sequence, 
  e.g., alternative sequences that may also satisfy the goal, as well as 
  sequences that may lead to failure in completing the service in case of 
  exceptional behavior, error handling, etc..</li>
<li>The system is treated as a &quot;black box&#8221;, thus, use cases capture who 
  (actor) does what (interaction) with the
  system, for what purpose (goal), without dealing with system internals.</li>
<li>A complete set of use cases specifies all the different ways to use the 
  system, and therefore defines the whole required behavior of the system. 
  Generally, use case steps are written in an easy-to-understand, structured 
  narrative using the vocabulary of the domain.</li>
<li>A scenario is an instance of a use case, and represents a single path 
  through the use case. Thus, there exists a scenario for the main flow 
  through the use case, and as many other scenarios as the possible variations 
  of flow through the use case (e.g., triggered by options, error conditions, 
  security breaches, etc.). Scenarios may also be depicted in a graphical form 
  using <a href="ActivityDiagrams.html">activity diagrams</a>.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/index.php/Basic_use_case_template">Basic use case template</a> (Alistair Cockburn)<br>
  In this textual notation, the main flow is expressed, in the &#8220;Description&#8221; 
  section, by an indexed sequence of natural language sentences, describing a 
  sequence of actions of the system. Variations are expressed (in the 
  &quot;Extensions&quot; section) as alternatives to the main flow, linked by their 
  index to the point of the main flow from which they branch as a variation.
