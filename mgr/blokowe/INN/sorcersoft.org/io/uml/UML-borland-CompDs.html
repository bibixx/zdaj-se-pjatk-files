<h2><a name="What_is_a_Component">What is a Component?</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	<body>A component is a self contained unit that encapsulates the state and 
	behavior of a number of classifiers. A component
	specifies a formal contract of the services that it provides to its clients 
	and those that it requires from other components
	or services in the system in terms of its provided and required interfaces.</body></li>
	<li>
	<body>A component is a substitutable unit that can be replaced at design 
	time or run-time by a component that offers equivalent
	functionality based on compatibility of its interfaces. As long as the 
	environment obeys the constraints expressed by the
	provided and required interfaces of a component, it will be able to interact 
	with this environment. Similarly, a system can
	be extended by adding new component types that add new functionality.</body></li>
	<li>
	<body>The required and provided interfaces of a component allow for the 
	specification of structural features such as attributes
	and association ends, as well as behavioral features such as operations and 
	events. A component may implement a
	provided interface directly, or, its realizing classifiers may do so. The 
	required and provided interfaces may optionally be
	organized through ports, these enable the definition of named sets of 
	provided and required interfaces that are typically
	(but not always) addressed at run-time.</body></li>
	<li>
	<body>A component has an external view (or &#8220;black-box&#8221; view) by means of its 
	publicly visible properties and operations.
	Optionally, a behavior such as a protocol state machine may be attached to 
	an interface, port, and to the component itself,
	to define the external view more precisely by making dynamic constraints in 
	the sequence of operation calls explicit.
	Other behaviors may also be associated with interfaces or connectors to 
	define the &#8216;contract&#8217; between participants in a
	collaboration (e.g., in terms of use case, activity, or interaction 
	specifications).</body></li>
	<li>
	<body>The wiring between components in a system or other context can be 
	structurally defined by using dependencies between
	component interfaces (typically on structure diagrams). Optionally, a more 
	detailed specification of the structural
	collaboration can be made using parts and connectors in composite 
	structures, to specify the role or instance level
	collaboration between components (See Chapter Composite Structures).</body></li>
	<li>
	<body>A component also has an internal view (or &#8220;white-box&#8221; view) by means 
	of its private properties and realizing classifiers.
	This view shows how the external behavior is realized internally. The 
	mapping between external and internal view is by
	means of dependencies (on structure diagrams), or delegation connectors to 
	internal parts (on composite structure
	diagrams). Again, more detailed behavior specifications such as interactions 
	and activities may be used to detail the
	mapping from external to internal behavior.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Component Notation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A component is shown as a Classifier rectangle with the keyword 
		«component». Optionally, in the right hand corner a
		component icon can be displayed. This is a classifier rectangle with two 
		smaller rectangles protruding from its left hand
		side.</li>
		<li>Black box notation</li>
	</ul>
	<blockquote>
		<p><img border="0" src="images/comp1.png" width="500" height="248"></p>
		<p>The ball-and-socket notation. A Component with two provided and three required interfaces</p>
	</blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>Alternatively, the interfaces and/or individual 
		operations and attributes can be listed in the compartments
		of a component box (for scalability, tools may offer way of listing and 
		abbreviating component properties and behavior).</li>
	</ul>
	<blockquote>
		<p><img border="0" src="images/comp2.png" width="300" height="350"><br>
		Black box notation showing a listing of the properties of a component</p>
	</blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>For displaying the full signature of an interface of a component, 
		the interfaces can also be displayed as typical classifier
		rectangles that can be expanded to show details of operations and 
		events.</li>
	</ul>

<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>
	<h2>White Box Components</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>An internal, or white box view of a Component is where the realizing 
		classifiers are listed in an additional compartment.
		Compartments may also be used to display a listing of any parts and 
		connectors, or any implementing artifacts.<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/UML-bo8.gif"><br>
		A white-box representation of a component</li>
	</ul>

	<p><img border="0" src="images/comp3.png" width="500" height="244"></p>
	<p>Nested representation</p>

<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>
	<h2>Internal Component Classifiers</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The internal classifiers that realize the behavior of a component 
		may be displayed by means of general dependencies.
		Alternatively, they may be nested within the component shape.<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/UML-bo9.gif"><br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>

<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>
	<h2>Ports and Combing Other Components</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Interfaces that are exposed by a Component and notated on a diagram, 
		either directly or though a port definition, may be
		inherited from a supertype component. These interfaces are indicated on 
		the diagram by preceding the name of the
		interface by a forward slash. An example of this can be found below, 
		where &#8220;/OrderableItem&#8221; can be an interface that is
		implemented by a supertype of the Product component.</li>
		<li>A delegation connector is notated as a Connector from the delegating 
		source Port to the handling target Part, and vice versa for required 
		Interfaces or Ports.</li>
		<li>An assembly connector is notated by a &#8220;ball-and-socket&#8221; connection 
		between a provided interface and a required interface. This notation 
		allows for succinct graphical wiring of components, a requirement for 
		scaling in complex systems.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><br><img border="0" src="images/UML-bo10.gif"><br>Example of a platform independent model of a component, its provided and 
		required interfaces, and wiring
		through dependencies on a structure diagram.</p>

<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>
	<h2>Component Assembly</h2>
	<p>In a system context where there are multiple components that provide or 
	require a particular interface, a notation abstraction can be used that 
	combines by joining the multiple connectors. This abstraction is similar to 
	the one defined for aggregation and subtyping relationships.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img border="0" src="images/UML-bo16.gif"></p>
	<p>As a notation abstraction, multiple wiring relationships can be visually 
	grouped together in a component assembly.</p>
