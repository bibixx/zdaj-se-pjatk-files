verbatim from <EM>Writing Effective Use Cases</EM>, by Alistair Cockburn 
(pronounced "Coburn"), Addison-Wesley, 2001, ISBN 0-201-70225-8. Note that "SuD" 
stands for "System under Development" (sometimes referred to as System under 
Discussion).

<P>Write something readable. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>Casual, readable use cases are still useful, whereas 
  unreadable use cases won't get read. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Work breadth-first, from lower precision to higher precision. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>Precision Level 1: Primary actor's name and goal<BR>Precision 
  Level 2: The use case brief, or the main success scenario<BR>Precision Level 
  3: The extension conditions<BR>Precision Level 4: The extension handling steps 
  </EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For each step: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>Show a goal succeeding.<BR>Capture the actor's intention, not 
  the user interface details.<BR>Have an actor pass information, validate a 
  condition, or update state.<BR>Write between-step commentary to indicate step 
  sequencing (or lack of).<BR>Ask "why" to find a next-higher level goal. 
</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For data descriptions (only put Precision Level 1 into the use case text): 
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>Precision Level 1: Data nickname<BR>Precision Level 2: Data 
  fields associated with the nickname<BR>Precision Level 3: Field types, 
  lengths, and validations<BR></EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <TR>
    <TD>Use Case Title</TD>
    <TD>1. Is it an active-verb goal phrase that names the goal of the primary 
      actor?<BR>2. Can the system deliver that goal?</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Primary Actor</TD>
    <TD>8. Does he/she/it have behavior?<BR>9. Does he/she/it have a goal 
      against the SuD that is a service promise of the SuD?</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Preconditions</TD>
    <TD>10. Are they mandatory, and can they be set in place by the 
      SuD?<BR>11. Is it true that they are never checked in the use case?</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Main Success<BR>Scenario</TD>
    <TD>15. Does it have 3-9 steps?<BR>16. Does it run from trigger to 
      delivery of the success guarantee?<BR>17. Does it permit the right 
      variations in sequencing?</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Each Step in Any<BR>Scenario</TD>
    <TD>18. Is it phrased as a goal that succeeds?<BR>19. Does the process 
      move distinctly forward after its successful completion?<BR>20. Is it 
      clear which actor is operating the goal--who is "kicking the ball"?<BR>21. 
      Is the intent of the actor clear?<BR>22. Is the goal level of the step 
      lower than the goal level of the overall use case? Is it, preferably, just 
      a bit below the use case goal level?<BR>23. Are you sure the step does not 
      describe the user interface design of the system?<BR>24. Is it clear what 
      information is being passed in the step?<BR>25. Does it "validate" as 
      opposed to "check" a condition?</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Extension Condition</TD>
    <TD>26. Can and must the system both detect and handle it?<BR>27. Is it 
      what the system actually needs?</TD></TR>

    <TD>Overall Use Case<BR>Content</TD>
    <TD>29. To the sponsors and users: "Is this what you want?"<BR>30. To the

      got this?"<BR>31. To the developers: "Can you implement 
  this?"</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
