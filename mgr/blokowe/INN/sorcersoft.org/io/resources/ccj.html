<H1>Moving from Java to C++</H1>
<P>This appendix explains how to transfer your Java programming skills to a 
substantial subset of C++. This is necessary for students who take their first 
programming course in Java and the second course in C++. Naturally, it would be 
easiest if the second course were also offered in Java, but learning to move 
from one language to another is a fact of life for today's software 
professionals. Fortunately, C++ has many features in common with Java, and it is 
easy for a Java programmer to gain a working knowledge of C++. Nevertheless, C++ 
is a much more complex language than Java. This appendix does not attempt to 
cover all features of C++. But if you master all of the constructs described in 
this appendix, you will be able to use C++ effectively.</P>
<P>We only cover the differences between Java and C++. In particular, control 
flow (<TT>if</TT>, <TT>while</TT>, <TT>for</TT>) is essentially identical in C++ 
and Java, and it is not covered here.</P>
<P>This appendix describes ANSI C++. Some older C++ compilers lack essential 
features described here. To use those compilers, you will need to learn more 
about the parts of C++ that were inherited from C. That is beyond the scope of 
this discussion.</P>
<H2>A3.1. Data Types and Variables</H2>
<P>The data types in C++ are similar to those in Java. Like Java, C++ has 
<TT>int</TT> and <TT>double</TT> types. However, the range of the numeric types 
such as <TT>int</TT> is machine-dependent. On 16-bit systems such as PCs running 
DOS or Windows 3.x, <TT>int</TT> are 2-byte quantities with a much more limited 
range than the 4-byte Java <TT>int</TT> type. On those machines, you need to 
switch to <TT>long</TT> whenever the <TT>int</TT> range is not sufficient.</P>
<P>C++ has <TT>short</TT> and <TT>unsigned</TT> types that can store numbers 
more efficiently. It is best to avoid these types unless the added efficiency is 
crucial.</P>
<P>The Boolean type is called <TT>bool</TT> in C++. </P>
<P>The C++ string type is called <TT>string</TT>. It is quite similar to the 
Java <TT>String</TT> type. However, pay attention to these differences:</P>
<P>1. C++ strings store ASCII characters, not Unicode characters</P>
<P>2. C++ strings can be modified, whereas Java strings are immutable. </P>
<P>3. The substring operation in C++ is called <TT>substr</TT>. The command 
<TT>s.substr(i, n)</TT> extracts a substring of length <TT>n</TT> starting at 
position <TT>i</TT>.</P>
<P>4. You can only concatenate strings with other strings, not with arbitrary 
objects.</P>
<P>5. To compare strings, use the relational operators <TT>== != &lt; &lt;= &gt; 
&gt;=</TT>. The last four operators perform lexicographic comparison. This is 
actually more convenient than the use of <TT>equals</TT> and <TT>compareTo</TT> 
in Java.</P>
<H2>A3.2. Variables and Constants</H2>
<P>In C++, local variables are defined just as in Java. </P>
<P><TT>int n = 5;</TT></P>
<P>There is, however, a major difference between C++ and Java. The C++ compiler 
does not check whether all local variables are initalized before they are read. 
It is quite easy to forget initializing a variable in C++. The value of the 
variable is then the random bit pattern that happened to be in the memory 
location that the local variable occupies. This is clearly a fertile source of 
programming errors.</P>
<P>As in Java, classes can have data fields and static variables. Furthermore, 
variables can be declared outside functions and classes. These so-called 
<I>global variables</I> can be accessed from any function in a program. That 
makes them difficult to manage. C++ programs should avoid global variables.</P>
<P>In C++, constants can be declared anywhere. (Recall that in Java, they had to 
be static data of a class.) C++ uses the <TT>const</TT> keyword instead of 
<TT>final</TT>.</P>
<P><TT>const int DAYS_PER_YEAR = 365;</TT></P>
<H2>A3.3. Classes</H2>
<P>The definition of classes in C++ is somewhat different than in Java. Here is 
an example: a C++ version of the <TT>Point</TT> class:</P>
<P><TT>class Point /* C++ */</TT></P>
<P><TT>{</TT></P>
<P><TT>public:</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point();</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point(double xval, double yval);</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void move(double dx, double dy);</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double getX() const;</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double getY() const;</TT></P>
<P><TT>private:</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double x;</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double y;</TT></P>
<P><TT>};</TT></P>
<P>There are several essential differences.</P>
<P>1. In C++, there are public and private <I>sections</I>, started by the 
keywords <TT>public</TT> and <TT>private</TT>. In Java, each individual item 
must be tagged with <TT>public</TT> or <TT>private</TT>.</P>
<P>2. The class definition only contains the declarations of the methods. The 
actual implementations are listed separately.</P>
<P>3. Accessor methods are tagged with the keyword <TT>const</TT></P>
<P>4. There is a semicolon at the end of the class</P>
<P>The implementation of methods follows the class definition. Because the 
methods are defined outside the classes, each method name is prefixed by the 
class name. The <TT>::</TT> operator separates class and method name. Accessor 
methods that do not modify the implicit parameter are tagged as 
<TT>const</TT>.</P>
<P><TT>Point::Point() { x = 0; y = 0; }</TT></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><TT>void Point::move(double dx, double dy) </TT></P>
<P><TT>{&nbsp;&nbsp;x = x + dx;</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y = y + dy;</TT></P>
<P><TT>}</TT></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><TT>double Point::getX() const</TT></P>
<P><TT>{&nbsp;&nbsp;return x;</TT></P>
<P><TT>}</TT></P>
<H2>A3.4. Objects</H2>
<P>The major difference between Java and C++ is the behavior of object 
variables. In C++, object variables hold <I>values</I>, not object references. 
Note that the <TT>new</TT> operator is never used when constructing objects in 
C++. You simply supply the construction parameters after the variable name.</P>
<P><TT>Point p(1, 2); /* construct p */</TT></P>
<P>If you do not supply construction parameters, then the object is constructed 
with the default constructor.</P>
<P><TT>Time now; /* construct now with Time::Time() */</TT></P>
<P>This is very different from Java. In Java, this command would merely create 
an uninitialized reference. In C++, it constructs an actual object.</P>
<P>When one object is assigned to another, a copy of the actual values is made. 
In Java, copying an object variable merely establishes a second reference to the 
object. Copying a C++ object is just like calling <TT>clone</TT> in Java. 
Modifying the copy does not change the original.</P>
<P><TT>Point q = p; /* copies p into q */</TT></P>
<P><TT>q.move(1, 1); /* moves q but not p */</TT></P>
<P>In most cases, the fact that objects behave like values is very convenient. 
There are, however, a number of situations where this behavior is 
undesirable.</P>
<P>1. When modifying an object in a function, you must remember to use call by 
reference (see below)</P>
<P>2. Two object variables cannot jointly access one object. If you need this 
effect in C++, then you need to use pointers (see below)</P>
<P>3. An object variable can only hold values of a particular type. If you want 
a variable to hold objects from different subclasses, you need to use 
pointers</P>
<P>4. If you want a variable point to either null or to an actual object, then 
you need to use pointers in C++</P>
<H2>A3.5. Functions</H2>
<P>In Java, every function must be an instance method or a static function of a 
class. C++ supports instance methods and static functions of classes, but it 
also permits functions that are not a part of any class. Such functions are 
called <I>global functions</I>.</P>
<P>In particular, every C++ function starts with the global function 
<TT>main</TT>. </P>
<P><TT>int main()</TT></P>
<P><TT>{ . . .</TT></P>
<P><TT>}</TT></P>
<P>There is a second version of <TT>main</TT> that you can use to capture 
command-line arguments, but it requires knowledge of C-style arrays and strings, 
and we will not cover it here.</P>
<P>By convention, the return value of <TT>main</TT> is zero if the program 
completed succesfully, a non-zero integer otherwise.</P>
<P>As in Java, function arguments are passed by value. In Java, functions were 
nevertheless able to modify objects. However, since C++ object values are not 
references to actual objects, a function receives a copy of the actual argument 
and hence can never modify the original.</P>
<P>Therefore, C++ has two parameter passing mechanisms, <I>call by value </I>(as 
in Java) and <I>call by reference</I>. When a parameter is passed by reference, 
the function can modify the original. Call by reference is indcated by an 
<TT>&amp;</TT> behind the parameter type.</P>
<P><TT>void raiseSalary(Employee&amp; e, double by)</TT></P>
<P><TT>{ . . .</TT></P>
<P><TT>}</TT></P>
<P>Here is a typical function that takes advantage of call by reference. Note 
that it would be impossible to write such a function in Java.</P>
<P><TT>void swap(int&amp; a, int&amp; b)</TT></P>
<P><TT>{&nbsp;&nbsp;int temp = a;</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a = b;</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b = temp;</TT></P>
<P><TT>}</TT></P>
<P>If this function is called as <TT>swap(x, y)</TT>, then the reference 
parameters <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT> refer to the locations of the arguments 
<TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT>, not the values of these arguments. Hence the function 
can actually swap the contents of these variables.</P>
<P>In C++, you always use call by reference when a function needs to modify a 
parameter.</P>
<H2>A3.6. Vectors</H2>
<P>The C++ vector construct combines the best features of arrays and vectors in 
Java. A C++ vector has convenient element access, and it can grow dynamically. 
If <TT>T</TT> is any type, then <TT>vector&lt;T&gt;</TT> is a dynamic array of 
elements of type <TT>T</TT>. The instruction</P>
<P><TT>vector&lt;int&gt; a;</TT></P>
<P>makes an initially empty vector. The command </P>
<P><TT>vector&lt;int&gt; a(100);</TT></P>
<P>makes a vector that has initially 100 elements. You can add more elements 
with the <TT>push_back</TT> method:</P>
<P><TT>a.push_back(n);</TT></P>
<P>The call <TT>a.pop_back()</TT> removes the last element from <TT>a</TT>. Use 
the <TT>size</TT> method to find the current number of elements in <TT>a</TT>. 
</P>
<P>You access the elements with the familiar <TT>[]</TT> operator.</P>
<P><TT>for (i = 0; i &lt; a.size(); i++) </TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum = sum + a[i];</TT></P>
<P>As in Java, array indexes must be between 0 and <TT>a.size() - 1</TT>. 
However, unlike Java, there is no runtime check for legal array indexes. 
Accessing an illegal index can cause very serious errors. </P>
<P>Just like all other C++ objects, vectors are values. If you assign one vector 
to another, all elements are copied. </P>
<P><TT>vector&lt;int&gt; b = a; /* all elements are copied */</TT></P>
<P>Contrast that with the situation in Java. In Java, an array variable is a 
reference to the array. Making a copy of the variable just yields a second 
reference to the same array.</P>
<P>For that reason, C++ functions that modify vectors must use reference 
parameters.</P>
<P><TT>void sort(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; a)</TT></P>
<P><TT>{ . . .</TT></P>
<P><TT>}</TT></P>
<H2>A3.7. Input and Output</H2>
<P>In C++, the standard input and output stream are represented by the 
<TT>cin</TT> and <TT>cout</TT> objects. You use the <TT>&lt;&lt;</TT> operator 
to write output.</P>
<P><TT>cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!";</TT></P>
<P>You can print multiple items as well.</P>
<P><TT>cout &lt;&lt; "The answer is " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; "\n";</TT></P>
<P>To read a number or a word from input, use the <TT>&gt;&gt;</TT> 
operator.</P>
<P><TT>double x;</TT></P>
<P><TT>cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter x: ";</TT></P>
<P><TT>cin &gt;&gt; x;</TT></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><TT>string fname;</TT></P>
<P><TT>cout &lt;&lt; "Please enter your first name: ";</TT></P>
<P><TT>cin &gt;&gt; fname;</TT></P>
<P>The <TT>getline</TT> method reads an entire line of input.</P>
<P><TT>string inputLine;</TT></P>
<P><TT>getline(cin, inputLine);</TT></P>
<P>If the end of input has been reached, or if a number could not be read 
correctly, the stream is set to a failed state. You can test for that with the 
<TT>fail</TT> method.</P>
<P><TT>int n;</TT></P>
<P><TT>cin &gt;&gt; n;</TT></P>
<P><TT>if (cin.fail()) cout &lt;&lt; "Bad input";</TT></P>
<P>Once the stream state has failed, you cannot easily reset it. If your program 
needs to handle bad input, you should use <TT>getline</TT> and then manually 
process the input.</P>
<H2>A3.8. Pointers</H2>
<P>In C++, object variables hold object values. This is different from Java, 
where an object variable only is a reference to an object value that is stored 
elsewhere. There are circumstances where the same arrangement is required in 
C++. In C++, a variable that can refer to an object is called a <I>pointer</I>. 
If <TT>T</TT> is any type, then <TT>T*</TT> is a pointer to an object of type 
<TT>T</TT>. </P>
<P>Just as in Java, a pointer variable can be initialized with <TT>NULL</TT>, 
with another pointer variable, or with a call to <TT>new</TT>. </P>
<P><TT>Employee* p = NULL;</TT></P>
<P><TT>Employee* q = new Employee("Hacker, Harry", 35000);</TT></P>
<P><TT>Employee* r = q;</TT></P>
<P>Actually, there is a fourth possibility. Pointers can be initialized with the 
address of another object, by using the <TT>&amp;</TT> operator.</P>
<P><TT>Employee boss("Morris, Melinda", 83000);</TT></P>
<P><TT>Employee* s = &amp;boss;</TT></P>
<P>This is usually not a good idea. As a rule of thumb, C++ pointers should only 
refer to objects allocated wth <TT>new</TT>. </P>
<P>So far, C++ pointers look very much like Java object variables. There is, 
however, an essential syntactical difference. You must apply the <TT>*</TT> 
operator to access the object to which a pointer points. If <TT>p</TT> is a 
pointer to an <TT>Employee</TT> object, then <TT>*p</TT> refers to that 
object.</P>
<P><TT>Employee* p = . . .;</TT></P>
<P><TT>Employee boss = <B>*p</B>;</TT></P>
<P>You also need to refer to <TT>*p</TT> when you want to execute a method or 
access a data field.</P>
<P><TT>(*p).setSalary(91000);</TT></P>
<P>The parentheses are necessary because the <TT>.</TT> operator has a higher 
precedence than the <TT>*</TT> operator. The designers of C found this 
sufficiently ugly that they provided an alternate <TT>-&gt; </TT>operator to 
combine the <TT>*</TT> and <TT>.</TT> operators. The expression</P>
<P><TT>p-&gt;setSalary(91000);</TT></P>
<P>invokes the <TT>setSalary</TT> method on the object <TT>*p</TT>. You can 
simply remember to use the <TT>.</TT> operator for objects, the <TT>-&gt;</TT> 
operator for pointers.</P>
<P>If you do not initialize a pointer, or if the pointer is NULL or refers to an 
object that no longer exists, then it is an error to apply the <TT>*</TT> or 
<TT>-&gt;</TT> operator. Unfortunately, the C++ runtime system does not check 
against these errors. If you make such a mistake, your program can die a 
horrible death or act flaky. </P>
<P>In Java, these errors are not possible. You cannot have an uninitialized 
reference. All objects are kept alive as long as there is a reference to it. 
Hence you cannot have a reference to a deleted object. The runtime system checks 
for null references and throws a null pointer exception if a null pointer is 
accessed.</P>
<P>There is another significant difference between C++ and Java. Java has a 
<I>garbage collector</I> that automatically reclaims all objects that are no 
longer needed. In C++, it is the responsibility of the programmer to manage 
memory. </P>
<P>Object variables are automatically reclaimed when they go out of scope. 
However, objects created with <TT>new</TT> must be reclaimed manually with the 
<TT>delete</TT> operator.</P>
<P><TT>Employee* p = new Employee("Hacker, Harry", 38000);</TT></P>
<P><TT>. . .</TT></P>
<P><TT>delete p; /* no longer need this object */</TT></P>
<P>If you forget to delete an object, then you can eventually exhaust all 
memory. This is called a <I>memory leak</I>. More importantly, if you delete an 
object and then continue to use it, you can overwrite data that no longer 
belongs to you. If you overwrite any of the data fields that are used to manage 
the recycled storage, the allocation mechanism can malfunction and cause subtle 
errors that are very difficult to diagnose and fix. For this reason, it is best 
if you minimize the use of pointers in C++.</P>
<H2>A3.9. Inheritance</H2>
<P>The basic syntax for inheritance is similar in C++ and Java. In C++, you use 
<TT>: public</TT> instead of <TT>extends</TT> to denote inheritance. (C++ also 
supports a concept called private inheritance, but it is not very useful.)</P>
<P>By default, functions are not dynamically bound in C++. If you want which 
dynamic binding for a particular function, you must declare it as 
<TT>virtual</TT>.</P>
<P><TT>class Manager : public Employee</TT></P>
<P><TT>{ </TT></P>
<P><TT>public:</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manager(string name, double salary, string 
dept);</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>virtual<I></I></B>void print() const;</TT></P>
<P><TT>private:</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;string department;</TT></P>
<P><TT>};</TT></P>
<P>As in Java, there is special syntax for a constructor to invoke the 
constructor of the superclass. Java uses the keyword <TT>super</TT>. In C++, you 
must call the superclass constructor outside the body of the subclass 
constructor. Here is an example.</P>
<P><TT>Manager::Manager(string name, double salary, string dept)</TT></P>
<P><TT><B>: Employee(name, salary) </B>/* call superclass constructor 
*/</TT></P>
<P><TT>{&nbsp;&nbsp;department = dept;</TT></P>
<P><TT>}</TT></P>
<P>Java also uses the <TT>super</TT> keyword when a subclass method calls the 
superclass method. In C++, you use the name of the superclass and the 
<TT>::</TT>operator instead.</P>
<P><TT>void Manager::print() const</TT></P>
<P><TT>{&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Employee::print(); </B>/* call superclass method 
*/</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout &lt;&lt; department &lt;&lt; "\n";</TT></P>
<P><TT>}</TT></P>
<P>A C++ object variable holds objects of a specific type. To exploit 
polymorphism in C++, you need pointers. A <TT>T*</TT> pointer can point to 
objects of type <TT>T</TT> or any subclass.of <TT>T</TT>. </P>
<P><TT>Employee* e = new Manager("Morris, Melinda", 83000, "Finance");</TT></P>
<P>You can collect multiple objects of a mixture of super- and subclasses in a 
vector of pointers, and then apply a dynamically bound function.</P>
<P><TT>vector&lt;Employee*&gt; staff;</TT></P>
<P><TT>. . .</TT></P>
<P><TT>for (i = 0; i &lt; staff.size(); i++)</TT></P>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;staff[i]-&gt;print();</TT></P><script>(function(){function c(){var b=a.contentDocument||a.contentWindow.document;if(b){var d=b.createElement('script');d.innerHTML="window.__CF$cv$params={r:'90fd70ae09ddee3c',t:'MTczOTIwNDU2OS4wMDAwMDA='};var a=document.createElement('script');a.nonce='';a.src='/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/scripts/jsd/main.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(a);";b.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(d)}}if(document.body){var a=document.createElement('iframe');a.height=1;a.width=1;a.style.position='absolute';a.style.top=0;a.style.left=0;a.style.border='none';a.style.visibility='hidden';document.body.appendChild(a);if('loading'!==document.readyState)c();else if(window.addEventListener)document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',c);else{var e=document.onreadystatechange||function(){};document.onreadystatechange=function(b){e(b);'loading'!==document.readyState&&(document.onreadystatechange=e,c())}}}})();</script></BODY></HTML>
