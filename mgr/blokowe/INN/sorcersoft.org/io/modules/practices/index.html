<h2>What is the Rational Unified Process</h2>
<p>The Rational Unified Process is a <b>Software Engineering Process</b>. </p>
<ul>
	<li>It provides a <b>disciplined approach</b> to</li>
assigning tasks and 
responsibilities within a development organization. 
	<li>Its goal is to ensure the production
of high-quality software that meets the needs of its end-users, within a 
predictable schedule and budget.
	<li>The Rational Unified Process <b>enhances team productivity</b>, by providing every team 
member with easy
access to a knowledge base with guidelines, templates and tool mentors for all 
critical development
activities. </li>
	<li>By having all team members accessing the same knowledge base, no 
matter if you work with
requirements, design, test, project management, or configuration management, we 
ensure that all team
members share a common language, process and view of how to develop software.</li>
	<li>The Rational Unified Process activities create and maintain <b>models</b>. Rather than 
focusing on the production
of large amount of paper documents, the Unified Process emphasizes the 
development and maintenance of models&#8212;semantically rich representations of the 
	software system under development. </li>
	<li>The Rational Unified Process is a guide for how to effectively use the 
	<b>Unified 
Modeling Language</b>
(UML). The UML is a industry-standard language that allows us to clearly 
communicate requirements,
architectures and designs. The UML was originally created by Rational Software, 
and is now maintained by
the standards organization Object Management Group (OMG). </li>
	<li>The Rational Unified Process is supported by <b>tools</b>, which automate large parts 
of the process. They are
used to create and maintain the various artifacts&#8212;models in particular&#8212;of the 
software engineering
process: visual modeling, programming, testing, etc. They are invaluable in 
supporting all the bookkeeping
associated with the change management as well as the configuration management 
that accompanies each
iteration.</li>
	<li>The Rational Unified Process is a <b>configurable process</b>. No single process is 
suitable for all software
development. The Unified Process fits small development teams as well as large 
development
organizations. The Unified Process is founded on a simple and clear process 
architecture that provides
commonality across a family of processes. Yet, it can be varied to accommodate 
different situations. It
contains a Development Kit, providing support for configuring the process to 
suit the needs of a given<br>organization.</li>
	<li>The Rational Unified Process captures many of the <b>best practices</b> in modern 
software development in a
form that is suitable for a wide range of projects and organizations. Deploying 
these best practices - using
the Rational Unified Process as your guide - offers development teams a number 
	of key advantages.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Effective Deployment of 6 Best Practices</h2>
<p>The Rational Unified Process describes how to effectively deploy commercially 
proven approaches to software development for software development teams. These 
are called &#8220;best practices&#8221; not so much because you can precisely quantify their 
value, but rather, because they are observed to be commonly used in industry by 
successful organizations. The Rational Unified Process provides each team member 
with the guidelines, templates and tool mentors necessary for the entire team to 
take full advantage of among others the following best practices:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Develop software iteratively</li>
	<li>Manage requirements</li>
	<li>Use component-based architectures</li>
	<li>Visually model software</li>
	<li>Verify software quality</li>
	<li>Control changes to software</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>
<h2>Develop Software Iteratively</h2>
<p>Given today&#8217;s sophisticated software systems, it is not possible to 
sequentially </p>
<ul>
	<li>first define the entire problem, </li>
	<li>design the entire solution, </li>
	<li>build the software and then </li>
	<li>test the product at the end. </li>
</ul>
<p>An iterative approach is required that allows an increasing understanding of 
the problem through successive refinements, and to incrementally grow an 
effective solution over multiple iterations.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Rational Unified Process supports an iterative approach to 
	development that addresses the highest risk items at every stage in the 
	lifecycle, significantly reducing a project&#8217;s risk profile. </li>
	<li>This iterative approach helps you attack risk through demonstrable 
	progress¾frequent, executable releases that enable continuous<br>
	end user involvement and feedback. </li>
	<li>Because each iteration ends with an executable release, the development 
	team stays focused on producing results, and frequent status checks help 
	ensure that the project stays on schedule. </li>
	<li>An iterative approach also makes it easier to accommodate tactical 
	changes in requirements, features or schedule. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Manage Requirements</h2>
<p>The Rational Unified Process describes how to elicit, organize, and document<br>
required functionality and constraints; track and document tradeoffs and 
decisions; and easily capture and<br>
communicate business requirements. The notions of use case and scenarios 
proscribed in the process has<br>
proven to be an excellent way to capture functional requirements and to ensure 
that these drive the design,<br>
implementation and testing of software, making it more likely that the final 
system fulfills the end user<br>
needs. They provide coherent and traceable threads through both the development 
and the delivered<br>
system.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>
<h2>Use Component-based Architectures</h2>
<p>The process focuses on early development and baselining of a<br>
robust executable architecture, prior to committing resources for full-scale 
development. It describes how<br>
to design a resilient architecture that is flexible, accommodates change, is 
intuitively understandable, and<br>
promotes more effective software reuse. The Rational Unified Process supports 
component-based software<br>
development. Components are non-trivial modules, subsystems that fulfill a clear 
function. The Rational<br>
Unified Process provides a systematic approach to defining an architecture using 
new and existing<br>
components. These are assembled in a well-defined architecture, either ad hoc, 
or in a component<br>
infrastructure such as the Internet, CORBA, and COM, for which an industry of 
reusable components is<br>
emerging.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>
<h2>Visually Model Software</h2>
<p>The process shows you how to visually model software to capture the<br>
structure and behavior of architectures and components. This allows you to hide 
the details and write code<br>
using &#8220;graphical building blocks.&#8221; Visual abstractions help you communicate 
different aspects of your<br>
software; see how the elements of the system fit together; make sure that the 
building blocks are consistent<br>
with your code; maintain consistency between a design and its implementation; 
and promote unambiguous<br>
communication. The industry-standard Unified Modeling Language (UML), created by 
Rational Software,<br>
is the foundation for successful visual modeling.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>
<h2>Verify Software Quality</h2>
<p>Poor application performance and poor reliability are common factors which<br>
dramatically inhibit the acceptability of today&#8217;s software applications. Hence, 
quality should be reviewed<br>
with respect to the requirements based on reliability, functionality, 
application performance and system<br>
performance. The Rational Unified Process assists you in the planning, design, 
implementation, execution,<br>
and evaluation of these test types. Quality assessment is built into the 
process, in all activities, involving all<br>
participants, using objective measurements and criteria, and not treated as an 
afterthought or a separate<br>
activity performed by a separate group.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>
<h2>Control Changes to Software</h2>
<p>The ability to manage change¾making certain that each change is<br>
acceptable, and being able to track changes¾is essential in an environment in 
which change is inevitable.<br>
The process describes how to control, track and monitor changes to enable 
successful iterative<br>
development. It also guides you in how to establish secure workspaces for each 
developer by providing<br>
isolation from changes made in other workspaces and by controlling changes of 
all software artifacts (e.g.,<br>
models, code, documents, etc.). And it brings a team together to work as a 
single unit by describing how to<br>
automate integration and build management.</p>

<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>
<h2>Two Dimensions</h2>
<p>The process can be described in two dimensions, or along two axis:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the horizontal axis represents time and shows the dynamic aspect of the 
	process as it is enacted, and it<br>
	is expressed in terms of cycles, phases, iterations, and milestones.</li>
	<li>the vertical axis represents the static aspect of the process: how it is 
	described in terms of activities,<br>
	artifacts, workers and workflows.</li>
</ul>

dimensions.</p>
