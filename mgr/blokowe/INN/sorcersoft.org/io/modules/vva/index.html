<h2>What Are Verification, Validation, and Accreditation?</h2>
<p>In the context of computer software, the terms verification, validation, and 
accreditation have specific meanings. </p>
<ul>
	<li>V&amp;V starts with <b>requirements reviews</b> and continues trough <b>
	design reviews</b> and <b>code inspections</b> to <b>product testing</b>.</li>
	<li>Three basic approaches<ul>
	<li><b>V&amp;V</b> can be done by the development team</li>
	<li><b>IV&amp;V</b> (uses third party)</li>
	<li>IV&amp;V can be done <b>concurrently </b>with SW development</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>IV&amp;V and VV&amp;A refer to the same fundamental activities, verification and 
	validation. Both verification and validation are best done by independent 
	organizations, and usually these activities are followed (when successful) 
	by accreditation.</li>
	<li><b>Verification</b> is an activity that determines whether the product of each 
	phase of the software development cycle <b>meets the requirements</b> made upon it 
	in each preceding phase, as in the questions <em>&quot;<b>Does the software design 
	satisfy all elements of the requirements?</b>&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;<b>Does the 
	implementation accurately reflect the design?</b>&quot;</em></li>
	<li><b>Validation</b> is an activity that answers the question, <em>&quot;<b>Is the 
	software suitable for its intended purpose?</b>&quot;</em> Provided the verification 
	activity has been properly performed, that question translates roughly to
	<em>&quot;<b>Does the software meet its requirements when it's run?</b>&quot;</em></li>
	<li>Accreditation is a milestone: when it is reached, the accrediting agency 
	issues a statement that the software product is appropriate for a specified 
	purpose within a well-defined set of circumstances. Accreditation must be 
	done by a respected authority in the field if the software's user community 
	is to have confidence in the software.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important that these activities are kept <em>independent</em> of the 
development activity and that they are conducted <em>rigorously</em>. This is, 
among other reasons, to ensure that the customer's confidence in the software 
can remain high.</p>

<h2>Verification</h2>
<p><b><i>Are we building the product right?</i> </b> </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The role of SW verification involves checking that the
	<font color="#FF0000">SW</font> conforms to its <font color="#FF0000">
	specification</font>.</b></li>
	<li>Have the model and simulation been built so 
that they fully satisfy the developer&#8217;s intent (as indicated in specifications)? 
	</li>
	<li>Verification has two aspects:
	<ul>
	<li>design (all specifications and nothing else are 
included in the model or simulation design) </li>
	<li>implementation (all 
specifications and nothing else are included in the model or simulation as 
built).</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>
<h2>Validation</h2>
<p><b><i>Are we building the right product?</i> </b> </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The aim of validation is to ensure that the <font color="#FF0000">SW 
	system</font> meets the <font color="#FF0000">customer's expectations</font>.</b></li>
	<li>Will the model or simulation be able to 
adequately support <b>its intended use</b>? </li>
	<li>Is its fidelity appropriate for that? 
	</li>
	<li>Validation has two aspects:
	<ul>
	<li>conceptual validation (when the anticipated fidelity 
of the model or simulation conceptual model is assessed) 
	</li>
	<li>operational validation 
(when results from the implemented model or simulation are compared with an appropriate referent to demonstrate that the model or simulation can in fact 
support the intended use).</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><i>Conceptual model validity</i> is defined as determining that the 
	theories and assumptions underlying the conceptual model are correct and 
	that the model representation of the problem entity is &#8220;reasonable&#8221; for the 
	intended purpose of the model. </li>
	<li><i>Computerized model verification</i> is defined as ensuring that the 
	computer programming and implementation of the conceptual model is correct. 
	</li>
	<li><i>Operational validity</i> is defined as determining that the model&#8217;s 
	output behavior has sufficient accuracy for the model&#8217;s intended purpose 
	over the domain of the model&#8217;s intended applicability. </li>
	<li><i>Data validity</i> is defined as ensuring that the data necessary for 
	model building, model evaluation and testing, and conducting the model 
	experiments to solve the problem are adequate and correct.</li>
	<li>The level of required confidence (&quot;fit for purpose&quot;) depends on the <b>
	system's purpose</b> (SW functions), the <b>expectations</b> of the system 
	users, and the <b>current marketing trends</b> (competition, price, quality)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Static and Dynamic V&amp;V</h2>
<p>Within the V&amp;V process there are two complementary approaches to the system 
checking and analysis:</p>
<ul>
	<li>System inspections or peer reviews</li>
	<li>SW testing</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>V&amp;V Planning (V-Model)</h2>

<h2>The Program Inspection Process</h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/inspectionProcess.png" width="650" height="143"></p>
<ul>
	<li>Find program defects rather than to consider broader design issues 
	(Fagan, IBM, 1970s).<br>
	Roles: author, reader, tester, moderator.&nbsp; The reader reads the code 
	aloud to the inspection team, the tester inspects the code from testing 
	perspective and the moderator organizes the process.</li>
	<li>More than 60% of errors in a program can be detected using informal 
	program inspections (Fagan).</li>
	<li>More formal approach to inspection based on correctness arguments can 
	detect more than 90% of the errors (Mills et al.).</li>
	<li>One of the most effective uses of reviews is to review the test cases 
	for a system (Gilb and Graham).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cleanroom SW Development</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The name is derived from the 'Cleanroom' process in semiconductor 
	fabrication. The philosophy is defect avoidance rather than defect removal.</li>
	<li>This software development process is based on:<ul>
		<li>Incremental development;</li>
		<li>Formal specification;</li>
		<li>Static verification using correctness arguments;</li>
		<li>Statistical testing to determine program reliability.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Cleanroom process teams<ul>
		<li>Specification team. Responsible for developing and maintaining the 
		system specification.</li>
		<li>Development team. Responsible for developing and verifying the 
		software. The software is NOT executed or even compiled during this 
		process.</li>
		<li>Certification team. Responsible for developing a set of statistical 
		tests to exercise the software after development. Reliability growth 
		models used to determine when reliability is acceptable.</li>
		<li>However, the process is not widely used. It is not clear how this 
		approach can be transferred to an environment with less skilled or less 
		motivated software engineers.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</li>

<h2>V&amp;V Techniques</h2>
Informal V&amp;V Techniques
<ul>
<li>Tools and approaches rely heavily on human reasoning and subjectivity</li>
<li>Does not include stringent mathematical formalism</li>
</ul>
Static V&amp;V Techniques
<ul>
<li>Assess the accuracy of the static model design and source code<br>
<li>Does not require machine execution of the model</li>
<li>Static &#8220;walk-through&#8221; of the execution can be done</li>
</ul>
Dynamic V&amp;V Techniques
<ul>
<li>Requires model execution<br>
<li>Evaluates the model based execution behavior</li>
</ul>
Formal V&amp;V Techniques (or Formal Methods)<br>
<ul>
<li>Based on formal mathematical proofs or correctness</li>
<li>Most thorough means of model V&amp;V</li>
<li>Require significant effort - best applied to complex problems</li>
</ul>
