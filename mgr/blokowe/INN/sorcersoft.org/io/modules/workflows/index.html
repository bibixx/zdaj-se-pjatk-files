<h2>Workflows</h2>
<p>A mere enumeration of all workers, activities and artifacts does not quite 
constitute a process. We need <br>
way to describe meaningful sequences of activities that produce some valuable 
result, and to show<br>
interactions between workers.<br>
<br>
A <b><i>workflow</i></b> is a sequence of activities that produces a result of observable 
value.<br>
<br>
In UML terms, a workflow can be expressed as a sequence diagram, a collaboration 
diagram, or an activity<br>
diagram. We use a form of activity diagrams in this white paper.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../rup/images/workflow.png" width="650" height="419"><br>
<br>
Example of workflow.<br>
<br>
Note that it is not always possible or practical to represent all of the 
dependencies between activities. Often<br>
two activities are more tightly interwoven than shown, especially when they 
involve the same worker or the<br>
same individual. People are not machines, and the workflow cannot be interpreted 
literally as a program for<br>
people, to be followed exactly and mechanically.</p>


<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>


<h2>Core workflows</h2>
<p>There are nine core process workflows in the Rational Unified Process, which 
represent a partitioning of all<br>
workers and activities into logical groupings.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../rup/images/rup2.png" width="650" height="413"><br>
The nine core process workflows.<br>
<br>
The core process workflows are divided into six core &#8220;engineering&#8221; workflows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Business modeling workflow</li>
	<li>Requirements workflow</li>
	<li>Analysis &amp; Design workflow</li>
	<li>Implementation workflow</li>
	<li>Test workflow</li>
	<li>Deployment workflow</li>
</ol>
<p>And three core &#8220;supporting&#8221; workflows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Project Management workflow</li>
	<li>Configuration and Change Management workflow</li>
	<li>Environment workflow</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the names of the six core engineering workflows may evoke the 
sequential phases in a traditional<br>
waterfall process, we should keep in mind that the phases of an iterative 
process are different and that these<br>
workflows are revisited again and again throughout the lifecycle. The actual 
complete workflow of a<br>
project interleaves these nine core workflows, and repeats them with various 
emphasis and intensity at each<br>
iteration.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Business Modeling</h2>
<p>One of the major problems with most business engineering efforts, is that the 
software engineering and the<br>
business engineering community do not communicate properly with each other. This 
leads to that the<br>
output from business engineering is not used properly as input to the software 
development effort, and viceversa.<br>
The Rational Unified Process addresses this by providing a common language and 
process for both<br>
communities, as well as showing how to create and maintain direct traceability 
between business and<br>
software models.<br>
<br>
In Business Modeling we document business processes using so called business use 
cases. This assures a<br>
common understanding among all stakeholders of what business process needs to be 
supported in the<br>
organization. The business use cases are analyzed to understand how the business 
should support the<br>
business processes. This is documented in a business object-model.<br>
Many projects may choose not to do business modeling.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>The goal of the Requirements workflow is to describe what the system should 
do and allows the developers<br>
and the customer to agree on that description. To achieve this, we elicit, 
organize, and document required<br>
functionality and constraints; track and document tradeoffs and decisions.<br>
<br>
A Vision document is created, and stakeholder needs are elicited. Actors are 
identified, representing the<br>
users, and any other system that may interact with the system being developed. 
Use cases are identified,<br>
representing the behavior of the system. Because use cases are developed 
according to the actor's needs, the<br>
system is more likely to be relevant to the users. The following figure shows an 
example of a use-case<br>
model for a recycling-machine system.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="../rup/images/atm-uc.png" width="600" height="455"><br>
An example of a use-case model with actors and use cases.<br>
<br>
Each use case is described in detail. The use-case description shows how the 
system interacts step by step<br>
with the actors and what the system does. Non-functional requirements are 
described in <i>Supplementary<br>
Specifications</i>.<br>
<br>
The use cases function as a unifying thread throughout the system's development 
cycle. The same use-case<br>
model is used during requirements capture, analysis &amp; design, and test.</p>


<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>


<h2>Analysis &amp; Design</h2>
<p>The goal of the Analysis &amp; Design workflow is to show how the system will be 
realized in the<br>
implementation phase. You want to build a system that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Performs&#8212;in a specific implementation environment&#8212;the tasks and functions 
specified in the usecase<br>descriptions.</li>
	<li>Fulfills all its requirements.</li>
	<li>Is structured to be robust (easy to change if and when its functional 
requirements change).</li>
</ul>
<p>Analysis &amp; Design results in a design model and optionally an analysis model. 
The design model serves as<br>
an abstraction of the source code; that is, the design model acts as a 
'blueprint' of how the source code is<br>
structured and written.<br>
<br>
The design model consists of design classes structured into design packages and 
design subsystems with<br>
well-defined interfaces, representing what will become components in the 
implementation. It also contains<br>
descriptions of how objects of these design classes collaborate to perform use 
cases. The next figure shows<br>
part of a sample design model for the recycling-machine system in the use-case 
model shown in the<br>
previous figure.<br>
<img border="0" src="../rup/images/order.png" width="600" height="334"><br>
Part of a design model, a composite structure of components, with connector 
wiring between provided and required interfaces of parts (Note: &#8220;Client&#8221; 
interface is a subtype of &#8220;Person&#8221;).<br>
<br>
The design activities are centered around the notion of architecture. The 
production and validation of this<br>
architecture is the main focus of early design iterations. Architecture is 
represented by a number of<br>
architectural views. These views capture the major structural design 
decisions. In essence, architectural<br>
views are abstractions or simplifications of the entire design, in which 
important characteristics are made<br>
more visible by leaving details aside. The architecture is an important vehicle 
not only for developing a<br>
good design model, but also for increasing the quality of any model built during 
system development.</p>


<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>


<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The purpose of implementation are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To define the organization of the code, in terms of implementation subsystems 
organized in layers.</li>
	<li>To implement classes and objects in terms of components (source files, 
binaries, executables, and<br>others).</li>
	<li>To test the developed components as units.</li>
	<li>To integrate the results produced by individual implementers (or teams), into 
an executable<br>system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system is realized through implementation of components. The Rational 
Unified Process describes<br>
how you reuse existing components, or implement new components with well defined 
responsibility,<br>
making the system easier to maintain, and increasing the possibilities to reuse.<br>
<br>
Components are structured into Implementation Subsystems. Subsystems take the 
form of directories, with<br>
additional structural or management information. For example, a subsystem can be 
created as a directory or<br>
a folder in a file system, or a subsystem in Rational/Apex for C++ or Ada, or 
packages using Java.&#8482;</p>


<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>


<h2>Test</h2>
<p>The purposes of testing are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To verify the interaction between objects.</li>
	<li>To verify the proper integration of all components of the software.</li>
	<li>To verify that all requirements have been correctly implemented.</li>
	<li>To identify and ensure defects are addressed prior to the deployment of the 
software.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Rational Unified Process proposes an iterative approach, which means that 
you test throughout the<br>
project. This allows you to find defects as early as possible, which radically 
reduces the cost of fixing the<br>
defect. Test are carried out along three quality dimensions reliability, 
functionality, application<br>
performance and system performance. For each of these quality dimensions, the 
process describes how you<br>
go through the test lifecycle of planning, design, implementation, execution and 
evaluation.<br>
<br>
Strategies for when and how to automate test are described. Test automation is 
especially important using<br>
an iterative approach, to allow regression testing at then end of each 
iteration, as well as for each new<br>
version of the product.</p>


<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>


<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>The purpose of the deployment workflow is to successfully produce product 
releases, and deliver the<br>software to its end users. It covers a wide range of activities including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Producing external releases of the software.</li>
	<li>Packaging the software.</li>
	<li>Distributing the software.</li>
	<li>Installing the software.</li>
	<li>Providing help and assistance to users.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases, this also includes activities such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Planning and conduct of beta tests.</li>
	<li>Migration of existing software or data.</li>
	<li>Formal acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although deployment activities are mostly centered around the transition phase, 
many of the activities need<br>
to be included in earlier phases to prepare for deployment at the end of the 
construction phase.<br>
The Deployment and Environment workflows of the Rational Unified Process contain 
less detail than other<br>
workflows.</p>


<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>


<h2>Project Management</h2>
<p>Software Project Management is the art of balancing competing objectives, 
managing risk, and overcoming<br>
constraints to deliver, successfully, a product which meets the needs of both 
customers (the payers of bills)<br>
and the users. The fact that so few projects are unarguably successful is 
comment enough on the difficulty<br>
of the task.<br>
<br>
This workflow focuses mainly on the specific aspect of an iterative development 
process. Our goal with<br>
this section is to make the task easier by providing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A framework for managing software-intensive projects.</li>
	<li>Practical guidelines for planning, staffing, executing, and monitoring 
projects.</li>
	<li>A framework for managing risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not a recipe for success, but it presents an approach to managing the 
project that will markedly<br>
improve the odds of delivering successful software. [14]</p>


<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>


<h2>Configuration &amp; Change Management</h2>
<p>In this workflow we describe how to control the numerous artifacts produced 
by the many people who<br>
work on a common project. Control helps avoid costly confusion, and ensures that 
resultant artifacts are not<br>
in conflict due to some of the following kinds of problems:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Simultaneous Update</b> - When two or more workers work separately on the same 
artifact, the last<br>one to make changes destroys the work of the former.</li>
	<li><b>Limited Notification</b> - When a problem is fixed in artifacts shared by several 
developers, and<br>some of them are not notified of the change.</li>
	<li><b>Multiple Versions</b> - Most large programs are developed in evolutionary 
releases. One release<br>could be in customer use, while another is in test, and the third is still in 
development. If problems<br>are found in any one of the versions, fixes need to be propagated between them. 
Confusion can<br>arise leading to costly fixes and re-work unless changes are carefully 
controlled and monitored.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workflow provides guidelines for managing multiple variants of evolving 
software systems, tracking<br>
which versions are used in given software builds, performing builds of 
individual programs or entire<br>
releases according to user-defined version specifications, and enforcing 
site-specific development policies.<br>
<br>
We describe how you can manage parallel development, development done at 
multiple sites, and how to<br>
automate the build process. This is especially important in an iterative process 
where you may want to be<br>
able to do builds as often as daily, something that would become impossible 
without powerful automation.<br>
We also describe how you can keep an audit trail on why, when and by whom any 
artifact was changed.<br>
<br>
This workflow also covers change request management, i.e. how to report defects, 
manage them through<br>
their lifecycle, and how to use defect data to track progress and trends.</p>


<HR align="left" width="100%" size="4" noshade>


<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>The purpose of the environment workflow is to provide the software 
development organization with the<br>
software development environment&#8212;both processes and tools&#8212;that are needed to 
support the development<br>
team.<br>
<br>
This workflow focuses on the activities to configure the process in the context 
of a project. It also focus on<br>
activities to develop the guidelines needed to support a project. A step-by-step 
procedure is provided<br>
describing how you implement a process in an organization.<br>
<br>
The environment workflow also contains a Development Kit providing you with the 
guidelines, templates<br>
and tools necessary to customize the process. The Development Kit is described 
in more detail in the<br>
section &quot; Development Kit for Process Customization&quot; found later in this paper.<br>
<br>
Certain aspects of the Environment workflow are not covered in the process such 
as selecting, acquiring,<br>
and making the tools work, and maintaining the development environment.</p>
