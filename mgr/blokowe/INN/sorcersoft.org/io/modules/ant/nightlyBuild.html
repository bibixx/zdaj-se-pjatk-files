<P>
<P><IMG height=29 alt=L src="nightlyBuild_files/L.gif" width=24 align=left>et's 
suppose you have arrived at a new job site or landed a new contract. You may be 
a bit nervous, but not too much so; you have a reasonable level of confidence in 
your Java development skills. The first thing you do is try to get up and 
running. You read some of the documentation. You look at the hardware available 
for use. You check out the code from the source control system and run the Ant 
scripts to see how the current product looks as opposed to the project described 
in the (probably out-dated) schedule. Good. 
<P>Then you actually get into the thick of things. Somebody on the team wastes 
half your day by making a bad check-in, which you end up debugging since you 
must get your code compiling (you do want to get some work done, after all). 
Another morning comes and goes when somebody makes a late-night check-in to meet 
a deadline, and nobody notices that the build is broken until half the team 
checks out the broken build. Any seasoned developer has dealt with these types 
of issues in a variety of forms (and any seasoned developer has broken the build 
as well). How do you protect yourself and the team from forgetting to check in 
files, from producing code that only compiles on your development machine, or 
from instigating other frustrating and time-wasting behavior? 
<P>One tool in your arsenal is a continual build system. Continual build systems 
may go as far as to compile and run the unit tests every time you check in 
modifications. Regardless of how often you build, you always want at least a 
nightly build system. The benefits of such systems are well understood in the 
industry now—I know of no software development methodology that does not 
advocate a nightly build. As with other tools, it is no magic bullet, but it is 
part of the toolkit necessary to produce quality software. 
<P>At some point, you will ask management how builds and releases are handled. 
You may be surprised to discover that the builds are handled by hand on a 
release-by-release basis, which is common. There may even be a person (or entire 
department) devoted to producing software builds. In such a shop, each developer 
is usually on her own vis à vis building and testing daily. You can imagine (and 
probably have experienced) the problems that such systems can produce. So why 
don't you have a nightly build? 
<P>Invariably, everyone agrees that a nightly build system would be nice. But no 
time has been budgeted for such a snazzy tool—tools are a notorious waste of 
time for engineers. Weeks can be whittled away playing with the tool and 
slipping on the feature set. Management will not budget time for a build tool 
that requires weeks to create. 
<P>In this article, I show you how to put together a basic build system in a 
couple of days. It is just a matter of making some installs and plugging in your 
Ant scripts. We use the open source Web application Anthill; you will find its 
configuration to be only a small part of setting up such a system. So let's get 
to it. 
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Prerequisites </STRONG></FONT><BR>To start, I presume 
the following about your situation and your abilities: You are a reasonably 
savvy Java developer. You have worked on at least a couple of Java projects, and 
you not only know the language, but you also know a bit about Web applications 
and servlet containers. I am also going to presume that you know a bit about Ant 
and how to use Ant scripts. Finally, I'm going to presume that you have some 
understanding of source code control and have already put your code into such a 
system. 
<P>What is my justification for such presumptions? First, brevity: my goal is 
explain how to quickly create a nightly build system, not how to use CVS 
(Concurrent Versions System). Second, practicality: while it is true that most 
shops have no functional build systems, it has always been true, in my 
experience, that shops have source code control. Third, my estimation of the 
time it will take you to set up the system is predicated on the expectation that 
such items like a Tomcat server don't intimidate you. If you already know about 
Web applications, then running one is no big deal. But if you have no idea about 
such things and something goes wrong, trouble-shooting how to run the Web 
application will dramatically increase your time. My assertion is that a 
professional Java developer can set up a nightly build system in two days or 
less. I say two days, because I recommend you spend some time reading the 
manuals for each system component. Reading manuals and downloading software 
simply takes time, so while you might do this in an afternoon, you should 
probably allocate a couple of days. 
<P><!-- break -->
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>The machine and its OS </STRONG></FONT><BR>We will 
create the example system on a Windows XP machine because it is common and, most 
likely, the kind of machine that you have easily available for use. The OS is 
really rather irrelevant. For Mac OS X, Linux, or Solaris users: you will set up 
a Java server and run a Java Web application. All the tools used are 
cross-platform or have a Unix equivalent. You do have to know how to do one 
thing: if I ask you to set an environment variable in the Windows environment, 
you will need to know how to set the environment variable in your flavor of 
Unix. Yes, that is it. You must know how to set environment variables and how to 
install off-the-shelf software. You will spend most of your time performing 
installations. 
<P>One item involving the path environment variable is of some importance: if 
you rely on running an executable from Ant, then the Anthill Web application 
requires it to be in your path. Sometimes when running an Ant script from 
Anthill, you will encounter Java I/O exceptions—Anthill's rather nonintuitive 
way of letting you know that it could not find an executable. So if your javac 
or devenv is not in your path, you will see these exceptions when you try to 
build those targets. 
<P>At this point, you've probably either grabbed a machine leftover from the 
last round of outsourcing or the box that you have not used since you last 
upgraded your equipment. Maybe it is a bit old, but I cannot think of a better 
use for an older, slower machine than a task that runs in the early hours of the 
morning! I presume the box is tabula rasa (that is, it has no tools on it), so I 
now will walk you through all the installations. 
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Source code control </STRONG></FONT><BR>In my example, 
we use CVS. The Anthill Web application supports more than just CVS. If you have 
Perforce, fine, please use it! But if you operate on the cheap, you can use CVS 
and get your code from a CVS password server (pserver) machine. 
<P>We start by downloading and installing the CVS client, <A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-06-2004/jw-0628-build_p.html#resources">WinCvs</A>. 
We are not so interested in using WinCvs as we are in getting CVSNT onto the 
box. This generally will not be an issue on a Unix box—CVS is standard fare on a 
box these days. 
<P>The installation itself (like most installations I mention) should be 
relatively simple and won't take much time. You won't have to use WinCvs 
(although you may want to test your CVS connection using the WinCvs client to 
ensure your machine can talk correctly to the CVS server). If you do choose to 
test your CVS connection, you will have to supply the server information either 
at startup or via the Admin/Preferences menu item (see Figure 1).

<P>An additional reason for using a client application such as WinCvs is because 
it provides a convenient way to log into the server. The build system requires 
that you log onto your CVS server—one of the simplest ways to do that is to 
simply start up WinCvs and log in using the Admin/Login menu item. Remember, you 
must be logged in for your build system to work. 
<P>The most important thing for you to do is to add CVS (in this case CVSNT) to 
your path. On an XP system, this will require going to the Control Panel and 
opening up the System dialog. Open the Advanced panel and select the Environment 
Variables button (see Figure 2). This will bring up a new dialog. Select the 
Path variable and edit it. Add the location of your CVSNT installation to your 
Path variable. In my case, I installed CVS into a standard location so that my 
new path looks like this: 
<P><STRONG>%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;C:\Program 
Files\GNU\WinCvs 1.3\CVSNT</STRONG>

<P>
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Ant </STRONG></FONT><BR>You need Ant on the system to 
run your Ant scripts. The download is available from the <A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-06-2004/jw-0628-build_p.html#resources">Apache 
Website</A>. You will want a new version of Ant since it includes support for 
newer targets as well as support for such things as bean shell scripting. On 
Windows machines, I typically install Ant on my C: drive—say, 
C:\apache-ant-1.6.1. 
<P>We need Ant to be in the path, so add <EM>c:\apache-ant-1.6.1\bin</EM> to 
your Path Environment variable. We also need to add <EM>ANT_HOME</EM> to our 
environment variables; you'll probably need to add this as a new value 
(<EM>ANT_HOME</EM> and <EM>C:\apache-ant-1.6.1</EM>). 
<P><STRONG>More on Ant and targets </STRONG><BR>Ant has evolved into a great 
system over the years and I recommend using it not just for Java projects, but 
also for .Net projects. Chances are, your current Ant targets end up creating 
the final JARs, shared libraries, DLLs (dynamic link libraries), executables, 
and support files inside the standard dist subdirectory. Regardless, once we 
finish installing Anthill, we will need to add a new target, <EM>Publish,</EM> 
to move the final product over to the Anthill directories (where it will be 
visible on the Web). So keep in mind that we will need to add a new target 
before all is said and done. 
<P><!-- break -->
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Java </STRONG></FONT><BR>Of course! Make sure that your 
box has the <A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-06-2004/jw-0628-build_p.html#resources">Java 
SDK</A> installed. A small point but, still, it must be there. Make sure that 
JAVA_HOME is set and that the sdk bin directory is your path for javac (in my 
case, that is C:\j2sdk1.4.2\bin). 
<P>At this point, you have a basic Java build environment on your system. You 
can test whether your Ant build scripts will run: you need to check the CVS 
module containing your code, open a command window, go to the check-out 
directory, and run the <CODE>ant</CODE> command. I presume your Ant script 
follows the conventional name: <CODE>build.xml</CODE>. 
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Tomcat </STRONG></FONT><BR>I freely admit that I am a 
bit of a Tomcat junkie. We need Tomcat to run our system, so go ahead and <A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-06-2004/jw-0628-build_p.html#resources">download 
it</A>. I use Tomcat 5.0, which is installed on XP as a service, but I start and 
stop from the command line. You can run Tomcat as a service, but if you run a 
nightly build on a dedicated machine, you should have an open window showing the 
output from the build system. It will make troubleshooting that much easier. But 
if you want to run as a service, feel free to do so. 
<P>In my case, running Tomcat means opening a command prompt and going to the 
Tomcat directory <CODE>C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 
5.0\bin&gt;</CODE> and then running the program <CODE>catalina.bat start</CODE>. 

<P>If you want to run Tomcat in the debugger, you run <CODE>catalina.bat debug 
start</CODE> and type <CODE>run</CODE> at the command prompt. 
<P>Regardless of how you run Tomcat, you should now be able to see your running 
Tomcat by clicking on your localhost at http://mymachine:8080. You should see 
the standard Tomcat page (I won't show it). Go ahead and shut down Tomcat by 
using the command <CODE>catalina.bat stop</CODE>. 
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Anthill </STRONG></FONT><BR>We are now ready for the 
final component in our build system: the open source Web application named 
Anthill. A professional version of Anthill is available, but, for our immediate 
purposes, the vanilla open source <A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-06-2004/jw-0628-build_p.html#resources">Web 
application</A> will do. 
<P>The download will be a gzipped (GNU zipped) tar file. So first, you must be 
able to unzip and untar the file. If you have a cross-mounted Unix box, you can 
do that there. If not, you may need to download the Cygwin bash shell, which 
contains both the gunzip and tar commands. Regardless, put all of the untarred 
files into a base directory; I use C:\anthill as my base directory. Within this 
directory you will now have a variety of subdirectories with names such as 
<EM>conf</EM> and <EM>publishDir</EM>. 
<P>One final step and we can start up the system. Tomcat needs the anthill.war 
Web application, which is in the dist directory (as befits an Ant-related Web 
application). So go to the dist directory and grab a copy of the anthill.war 
file. Paste this copy into your Tomcat webapps subdirectory. This will be: 
<P><STRONG>C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 
5.0\webapps</STRONG> 
<P>Now restart Tomcat. 
<P>Bring up a browser and hit the Anthill page: 
http://yourmachine:8080/anthill/. You'll be requested to enter in the base 
directory (<EM>C:\anthill</EM>). Figure 3 illustrates the Anthill page.

<P>We need to change this page like so: 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>We want to point to our newer version of Ant so set anthill.ant.home to 
  <EM>..\apache-ant-1.6.1\lib</EM> 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The anthill.mail.host and anthill.mail.from fields should reflect your 
  mail server configuration 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Rename the title of your system using anthill.title.text—doing so makes 
  your system a bit more professional</LI></OL>
<P>As you can see, customizing Anthill is very simple. The only reason we update 
the Ant version is so that our Ant scripts can take advantage of new Ant 
features. Otherwise, we could even use the default version of Ant that comes 
with Anthill. 
<P><STRONG>Make a new project </STRONG><BR>So you have verified that Anthill is 
running and you have set your general Anthill properties. It's time to put this 
project to bed and head for home (unless, of course, you are working out of your 
house). Do the following step: 
<P>On the Anthill Build Management Server page, click on Create a New Project. 
That link will take you to the Anthill Properties page. Complete the following 
steps: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Set anthill.project.name to reflect your work; e.g., 
  <EM>FischerContract</EM>. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Click on the link for configuring the UrbanCodeVersionAdapter. Now what is 
  this, you ask? Anthill has a nice feature in that it will increase your 
  application's version number with each build. So if our CVS module's name is 
  FischerContract, then we need to add a version file into CVS from which 
  Anthill can get and set the version number. I always name this file 
  <EM>version</EM>. So we create the file version at the top of the directory 
  structure of our FischerContract module. We edit the version file and add the 
  word <EM>FischerContract-1.0.0.0</EM> inside it. With each build, the version 
  number increases. So the first time we build, the version file contains 
  <EM>FischerContract-1.0.0.1</EM>. The file will increase with each build to 
  1.0.0.2, 1.0.0.3, etc. When you become a sophisticated Ant user, you can use 
  this version number in your Ant script to specify a version-specific directory 
  for each build. But for now, we will avoid this additional complication and 
  simply increase the version number in the file. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Click on the CVSRepositoryAdapter and specify that the work directory is 
  <EM>work</EM>. 
  <P>Additionally, you must specify the CVS module (FischerContract) and the CVS 
  root (:pserver:<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e08488818e93858ea0d1d0ced0ced0ced1">[email&#160;protected]</a>:/export/cvsroot). Finally, you need to dispose 
  of the anthill user field—just leave it blank. 
  <P>Your final CVS page will look something like Figure 6.

  <P>Leave the rest of the parameters alone for the moment. We leave this page

  <P>At this point you should have a build page similar to one in Figure 7.

<P>So let's run a test build. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Make sure you are logged 
onto your CVS pserver at this time. Click on the Build link and select the Force 
toggle. Now press the Build button. You'll return to the main build page and see 
that the Build Queue now contains an entry for the new project 
(<EM>FischerContract—Being built</EM>). 
<P>In the Tomcat output window, you'll notice that Anthill goes through many 
steps. In the first step, Anthill checks the code from CVS. If you have a big 
project, this could take a while. When all is said and done, you should have a 
successful build, which will show up as a green box (see Figure 8), while a 
build failure will appear red.

<P><STRONG>Set up the nightly schedule </STRONG><BR>To schedule a nightly build, 
we must complete two tasks: First, we must create a nightly schedule. Second, we 
associate that schedule with our project. Making a schedule is easy—click on the 
Create Schedule link on the main build page. Name your schedule and set the time 
interval between builds to 1,440 minutes (one day). Set your start time (2:00 
for 2 a.m.) and you are done. Hit Update to return to the main build page. Now 
click on the Edit link next to your project. You return to your Project 
Properties page. Down at the bottom, simply select the nightly schedule for the 
anthill.schedule field. That's it. You now have a nightly build system. 
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Conclusion </STRONG></FONT><BR>Once you've set up your 
nightly build system, you'll be tempted to spend time adding additional 
capabilities to it. I encourage you to scratch this itch. You'll find that with 
Ant's newer bean script integration, you can produce separate build directories 
for each build or release. Then you can zip up the contents for easy download 
from the builds page. You'll automate production of the executable JARs. You'll 
inevitably start producing your own Webstart-enabled JARs. Perhaps you produce 
your own installer; with the currently available open source installers, it is 
not too hard to do. With Ant's FTP capabilities, you may start pushing the 
resulting code out to other sites. 
<P>I think that the Tomcat, Ant, and Anthill combination shows the power of the 
maturing Java technology. It is a portable framework that, with minimal 
presumptions, allows a developer to easily produce a sophisticated, powerful 
build system. This combination is not the best build system I have seen. It is, 
however, the best build system that a single developer can put together in a 
short period of time. <IMG height=12 src="nightlyBuild_files/jw-dingbat.gif"
